    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I am a systems-oriented engineer who builds and owns real-time infrastructure, internal platforms, and data pipelines that support product and operational decision-making. I design systems that transform noisy inputs such as live events, conversations, and logs into durable, reusable state for downstream systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have designed systems on critical paths, including ingestion pipelines, internal APIs, automation layers, and behavioral data workflows. My work prioritizes clear boundaries, predictable behavior, and designs that other engineers can extend without needing to reverse-engineer intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site documents architectural decisions behind those systems, including constraints, tradeoffs, and how designs evolved over time. The goal is accurate, useful technical documentation rather than presentation.
